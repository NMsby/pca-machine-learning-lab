# Principal Component Analysis (PCA) Lab

A comprehensive implementation and analysis of Principal Component Analysis for Machine Learning.
This project demonstrates PCA from mathematical foundations to real-world applications.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This repository contains a complete exploration of PCA including:
- **Mathematical foundations** and theoretical derivations
- **From-scratch implementation** using NumPy
- **Scikit-learn applications** on real datasets
- **Data compression** and feature extraction examples
- **Kernel PCA** for nonlinear dimensionality reduction

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Manual PCA implementation with comprehensive testing
- ✅ Interactive Jupyter notebooks with detailed explanations
- ✅ Real-world dataset analysis (Iris, MNIST, Faces)
- ✅ Data compression with quality analysis
- ✅ Classification performance comparison
- ✅ Professional visualizations and reporting
